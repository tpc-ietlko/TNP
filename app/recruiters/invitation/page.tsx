                It gives me immense pleasure to extend to you the most cordial
                invitation to you to participate in the Campus Recruitment
                programme of our Institute. Now, more than ever, the emphasis is

                conducting the Campus Recruitment programme and the Industry,
                participating in the same, are bound to find it mutually
                beneficial.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
